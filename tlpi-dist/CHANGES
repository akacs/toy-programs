This file summarizes the changes that have been made since publication
to the program examples printed in "The Linux Programming Interface".
Background on some of these changes can be found in the online errata
for TLPI, available at http://man7.org/tlpi/errata/.

        signals/t_kill.c
                Fixed an error in a diagnostic message. See the erratum
                for page 406.

2011-07-06
        Makefile
                Added missing "memalloc" to the directory list.

        acl/acl_view.c
                Fixed a small bug as per the erratum for page 336.

2011-09-04
        pipes/popen_glob.c
        procexec/make_zombie.c
        sockets/inet_sockets.c
                Removed an unnecessary assignment statement that added
                a terminating null byte to the string buffer output by
                snprintf().  See the erratum for page 555.

2011-12-05
        dirs_links/t_unlink.c
                Added a comment referring to the erratum for page 348.

2011-12-06
        pty/unbuffer.c
                Change parent exit status when read() returns <= 0
                from EXIT_FAILURE to EXIT_SUCCESS.

        signals/catch_rtsigs.c
                Restore 3 lines that were accidentally omitted at the
                end of this program. See the erratum for page 463.

2011-12-31
        threads/thread_incr.c
                Make global variable 'glob' volatile, so that the program
                more easily produces "incorrect" behavior, even in the face
                of compiler optimizations. See the erratum for page 632.
